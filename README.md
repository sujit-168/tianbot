# Tianbot
Tianbot is a series of robots developed based on DJI RoboMaster boards, motors and contollers. The typical design is a mecanum-wheeled robot with omni-directional movement. Moreover, differetial drive and ackermann steering geometry like a mars-rover are also supported. This is a mapping to navigation software framework supporting all kinds of Tianbot robots. It can be easily deployed to your own robot.  

As long as you can apply the framework to your own robot, it is can be easily to form a group of robots and to do some fancy multi-robot experiment. The framework supports multi-robots very well. 

## Introduction
[Tianbot ROS Wiki](https://wiki.ros.org/tianbot)
Our goal is to develop a platform can be customized easily and the code can be deployed without any modification.

## Purchase from Tianbot Official Taobao Store

Tianbot platform can be ordered from out online shop. However, this platform is mainly for customization.

git clone https://github.com/tianbot/tianbot.git
git clone https://github.com/tianbot/tianbot_core.git
cd ~/catkin_ws && catkin_make
```

## Interfacing
Tianbot can be brought up all at once, or separately.
```
roslaunch tianbot_bringup tianbot_bringup.launch
```
### Tianbot Base
```
roslaunch tianbot_core tianbot_core.launch
```

### Lidar
```
roslaunch tianbot_bringup lidar.launch
```

### RGBD Camera (if applicable)
```
roslaunch tianbot_bringup rgbd_camera.launch
```

### USB Camera
```
roslaunch tianbot_bringup usb_cam.launch
```

### GPS (if applicable)
```
roslaunch tianbot_bringup gps.launch
```

## Mapping
After bringing up the Tianbot, we provide three methods to perform slam for 2D laser.

### GMapping
```
roslaunch tianbot_slam tianbot_gmapping.launch
```
### HectorSLAM
```
roslaunch tianbot_slam tianbot_hector.launch
```
### Cartographer
```
roslaunch tianbot_slam tianbot_cartographer.launch
```
### Save the Map
Map will be saved as tianbot_office in tianbot_slam/maps/
```
roslaunch tianbot_slam map_save.launch
```

## Navigation
After saving the map, the map can be used to perform navigation.
```
roslaunch tianbot_navigation tianbot_nav.launch
```
Configure running ROS across multiple machines, then launch rviz in a PC with display
```
roslaunch tianbot_rviz view_nav_amcl.launch
```
